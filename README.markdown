-----------------------------

This repository contains patches against specific llvm/clang releases, code examples, and Xcode support files. Some of this is obsolete, but left here for historical purposes (directly transferred from the old Trac project).

Current work on the 3.0 release and trunk can be found under this organization at <a href="https://github.com/eerolanguage/clang-3.0">eerolanguage/eero-3.0</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eerolanguage/clang-trunk">eerolanguage/eero-trunk<a/>.
