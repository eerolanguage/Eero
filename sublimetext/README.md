## Support files for Sublime Text

**eero.tmLanguage** is the Eero syntax definition file (for source code highlighting). Needs to be installed.

**Comments (Eero).tmPreferences** is the Eero comment/uncomment enabler. Needs to be installed.

**eero.YAML-tmLanguage** is the Eero syntax definition YAML *source* file. You don't need to mess with this
 unless you want to improve the syntax definitions.

**Eero Dark.tmTheme** is an example color theme that exercises all of the defined elements in the Eero syntax definition. You can install it, if you like, but it isn't necessary for anything.


Tested with Sublime Text 2 and Sublime Text 3 Beta.
